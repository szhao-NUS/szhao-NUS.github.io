<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a senior research fellow in National University of Singapore. My research is centered around the field of environmental microbiology, with a specialized focus on anaerobic/anoxic microbial processes. By integrating advanced cultivation and isolation methods, employing biochemical and genetic procedures, applying the state-of-the art analytical instrumentation, and exploiting high-throughput genomics and proteomics approaches, the aim is to advance the understanding of novel microorganisms and corresponding bioprocesses, so as to harness them to address environmental challenges.


## Research Interest

- **Environmental Microbiology** Identify novel metabolic/enzymatic pathways for contaminant remediation; Use metagenomics to drive cultivation-based hypothesis-testing experiments and selective enrichment/species isolations; Understand key environmental factors that shape microbial communities; Predict adaptations in microbial communities and their functionality under changing environmental conditions
- **Bioremediation of persistent organic pollutants and emerging contaminants**
- **Microbial Source Tracking for Water quality monitoring and safety management** 
- **Biological nutrients removal in wastewater treatment processes**
- **Innovate molecular techniques**for studying microbial ecology of communities and novel metabolism of microbes in bioremediation of persistent pollutants, drinking water distribution system, and wastewater treatment
