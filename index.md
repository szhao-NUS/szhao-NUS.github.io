I am currently a senior research fellow in National University of Singapore. My research is centered around the field of environmental microbiology, with a specialized focus on anaerobic/anoxic microbial processes. By integrating advanced cultivation and isolation methods, employing biochemical and genetic procedures, applying the state-of-the art analytical instrumentation, and exploiting high-throughput genomics and proteomics approaches, the aim is to advance the understanding of novel microorganisms and corresponding bioprocesses, so as to harness them to address environmental challenges.


## Research Interest

- Environmental pollution control of persistent organic pollutants and emerging contaminants 
- Water quality monitoring and safety management in water supply system
- Nutrients removal in wastewater treatment processes
- Innovate molecular techniques for studying microbial ecology of communities and novel metabolism of microbes in drinking water distribution system, wastewater treatment and bioremediation communities.
